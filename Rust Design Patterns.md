These notes are in reference to the book [Rust Design Patterns](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/)

### There are three categories the book touches on
* [[Idioms]] - Norms followed within the language and community
* [[Design patterns]] - Solutions to common problems
* [[Anti-patterns]] - Bad habits that programmers fall into that may work in other languages but are counter productive in Rust
