A strongly typed programming language that emphasises ==memory safety== through the use of [[lifetimes]] and [[borrowing]], as well as a robust ==error handling== by forcing developers to consider errors and None types to compile ([[Option]] and [[Result]] types).

Rust allows for grouping a variety of different types into a single type through the use of [[Structs]] and [[Enums]] and allows for forcing behaviours of class functions through the use of [[Traits]].
